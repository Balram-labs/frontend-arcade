# 🎮 Frontend Arcade

**Frontend Arcade** is a hands-on practice repository dedicated to building real  
**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** projects from scratch to continuously strengthen  
practical frontend development skills.

This repository is designed as a structured environment for:

- consistent and disciplined coding practice  
- reinforcing understanding of **Git & GitHub collaboration**  
- creating reusable UI components and small real-world applications  
- progressing steadily from **foundational knowledge → professional confidence**

It represents an **open learning journey focused on real implementation**,  
not perfection.

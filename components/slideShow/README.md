## 📸 Slideshow Project

Live Demo: https://slideshowby-shanni-and-balram.netlify.app/

This is a **simple image slideshow** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to:

- Navigate between multiple images using previous and next controls  
- View one slide at a time with clean transitions  
- See captions under each slide  

The core functionality is implemented with JavaScript, where only the selected slide is shown and all others are hidden. Navigation dots and arrows allow users to jump between slides manually.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML — structure of the slides  
- CSS — styling and layout  
- JavaScript — slide navigation and dynamic display

### 📦 Key Features

- Manual slide navigation  
- Display only one slide at a time  
- Works in modern browsers without dependencies
